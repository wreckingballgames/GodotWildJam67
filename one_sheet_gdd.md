**Summary:** Andere is a former mercenary traveling through the realm of Albion for reasons unknown. One day, she wakes up in her inn room with a strange, purple parasite attached to her at the shoulder. Andere is unable to remove the creature, who she names L'Ã‰tranger (Tranger for short), and begins building rapport through telepathic communication. Tranger gives Andere some vague leads about a faction striking back at Andere for her actions during her mercenary days, and Andere sets out to learn more and remove Tranger before her life force is spent. In order to face the many dangers of the world and the people opposing her, Andere must constantly decide whether or not to allow Tranger to bond with more of her body, either accepting its immense power or clinging to her soul.

**Distinct modes of gameplay:**

- Overworld traversal in an oblique perspective
- Turn-based RPG combat with engaging gameplay
- Character management menus, shops, and dialog with NPCs

**Unique selling points:**

- Instead of straightforward leveling up, the player is tempted again and again with increasing their "Parasite Points" to become exponentially more powerful at the risk of Andere losing her soul
- Turn-based RPG combat with a twist; your outcome each turn is based on your performance in tiny micro-games similar to top-down retro games from the past, like Bomberman and Dig-Dug
- A variety of equipment to discover or buy and the ever-present option to forsake equipment slots for parasitic enhancements
- Unique attack patterns to learn and enhance and the ability to opt for parasitic powers using PP instead
- Different treatment from people in the world, plot turns, and endings based on how the player balances the use of Tranger
