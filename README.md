# Godot Wild Jam 67

My entry for the Godot Wild Jam, number 67. Time to finish a game jam entry again. I'm going to strive to keep the main branch clean and use other branches for designing in plaintext and developing features. That method as well as using C# are practices I want to get used to in my game development projects.
