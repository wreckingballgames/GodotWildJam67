# Godot Wild Jam 67

My entry for the Godot Wild Jam, number 67. Time to finish a game jam entry again. I'm going to strive to keep the main branch clean and use other branches for designing in plaintext and developing features. I was planning to use C# for this project as practice, but I changed my mind. The state of C# in Godot 4 is not the best right now and this game is data-heavy, which (in terms of Godot API collections) is inefficient in C# anyway.

## Theme

**PARASITE**

## Wild Cards

1. **GRIDLOCK** - Restrict movement to a grid.
2. **ROSHAMBO** - What beats one is beaten by the other.
3. **SILLINESS SWITCH** - Googly eyes, fake moustaches, big head mode, etc.
