# Ideas & Notes

- The zweihander seems ubiquitous for the landsknecht type and I've been iffy on the shield thing (doubly iffy on balancing two-handed weapons or one-handed weapons and a shield slot, at least for this game jam game) so I'm simplifying and making Andere's only weapon choice being different zweihanders or the parasite weapon slot
- In line with the microgames in battle, I think an auto-runner kind of thing would be a good one. That might make a good one for the default attack, something really simple. "Running" could be a solid theme for Andere, too. Another good microgame could be a little puzzle setup where you have to swap two pieces on the other side of the board to get a bonus.
- I think the microgames themes should be based on the attack or technique Andere is using, with the enemy number and types determining "bullet" patterns overlaid on the game. The enemy part is kind of similar to Undertale and calls for being very careful about managing the interaction between groups of enemies and the techniques Andere can use. You need to make sure all techniques are possible to do against all combinations of enemies, even if very difficult. I think it would make this a lot easier if I just make sure enemies only contribute a couple of bullets each. Maybe one Zapling just makes lightning bolts go down the screen alternately from two spots at the top of the battle area.
